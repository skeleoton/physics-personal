This project outputs graphs based on inputted slider values, it uses common undergrad kinematic equations that can be found in the eq.py file :)

- This model assumes constant acceleration & does not include jerk, pop, etc.
- The aux & eq python files are helper modules for better readability in the sandbox
- If you want to see the model copy & paste the sandbox.py code into a python file and run to launch the vizualizer.

[NOTE] You will need to download both eq.py & aux.py for the vizualizer to work OR edit sandbox.py respectively and add eq.py & aux.py's auxiliary functions into that script.
