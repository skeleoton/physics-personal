# H1 This project outputs graphs based on inputted slider values, it uses common undergrad kinematic equations that can be found in the eq.py file :)
This project's goal is to act as an easy to access personal tool when dealing with simple kinematics.
This is was just a small project to dip my feet into vizualizing physics with a small 2-3 hours to write and study enough to write the program.
Overall good experience, think I will try py game or find a different visualizer maybe so I can render physical models in 3D I think that would be super cool.

- This model assumes constant acceleration & does not include jerk, pop, etc.
- The aux & eq python files are helper modules for better readability in the sandbox
- If you want to see the model copy & paste the sandbox.py code into a python file and run to launch the program.

[NOTE] You will need to download both eq.py & aux.py for the vizualizer to work OR edit sandbox.py respectively and add eq.py & aux.py's auxiliary functions into that script.
