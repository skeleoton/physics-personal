A work in progress personal physics lab notebook, essentially a place I can keep track of my physics work.

Template:

projects/ : Coding physics projects relative to their name
papers/ : WIP Papers & Finished papers in .PDF format.
data/ : Place where I keep datasets for personal projects indicated by name
figures/ : Place where I keep figures for personal projects indicated by name 

Workflow => Work on project git push => if on another device => git pull

That's it. Just a place where I can organize my work.
